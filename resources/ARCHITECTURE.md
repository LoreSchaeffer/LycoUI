# Lyco UI

`lyco-ui` is an agnostic, scalable, and performance-focused UI component library and Design System built on an NPM Workspace monorepo architecture.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The visual language diverges from traditional flat design, introducing a modern, depth-oriented aesthetic:
* **Depth & Textures:** Heavy reliance on subtle gradients, multi-layered box-shadows, and noise textures. It achieves a tactile feel without relying on pure glassmorphism.
* **Rounded Geometry:** High border-radius values across surfaces and interactive elements for a fluid, organic appearance.
* **Component-Level Flat Override:** Every component supports a strict `isFlat` fallback toggle, instantly stripping gradients and textures to render a pure, solid-color variant.
* **Responsive First:** The layout system is heavily inspired by Bootstrap 5's flexbox grid, ensuring absolute layout uniformity and fluid adaptation across all viewports.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The workspace utilizes the following unified ecosystem:

### Core Framework & Language
* **React 19**: Utilized at version `^19.2.7` for crafting the user interface components.
* **TypeScript**: Configured at version `~7.0.2` to ensure strict, enterprise-level static typing across all components and their respective Props.

### Styling & Tokenization
* **Sass (SCSS)**: Version `^1.101.0`. Provides the logical infrastructure (advanced `@each`, `@for` loops, and `@mixin` directives) to map design tokens and compile utilities and global classes.
* **Clsx**: Version `^2.1.1`. A core utility for conditionally manipulating and cleanly concatenating CSS classes within React components.

### Build Tool & Monorepo
* **Vite 8**: Configured at version `^8.1.4`. Powers both the library compilation (via Rolldown) and the lightning-fast HMR development server for the documentation playground.
* **NPM Workspaces**: Architected to strictly separate the `core` UI library from the `docs` consumption playground, ensuring zero-overhead dogfooding without third-party dependencies.

## 📂 Repository Architecture (Monorepo)

The source directory strictly isolates the compiled library from the testing environment:

## 🔄 Workflow & Available Scripts
Execute these commands from the root directory to orchestrate the workspaces:

- `npm run dev:docs`: Starts the documentation playground. Automatically intercepts core imports via Vite alias for instant HMR without requiring pre-builds.
- `npm run build`: Executes the production build across all workspaces (core library and docs static site).
- `npm run clean`: Purges all node_modules and dist directories across the workspace to reset the environment.
